# AudioChain Refactor: From Virtual Device to Input Selection

## What Changed

The AudioChain application has been refactored from a complex virtual audio device approach to a much simpler audio input selection approach.

### Before (VirtualAudioDriver)
- Complex platform-specific virtual device creation
- Required BlackHole on macOS for proper functionality
- Attempted to create actual virtual audio devices
- ~700+ lines of complex Core Audio code
- Many platform-specific edge cases and compatibility issues

### After (AudioInputManager)
- Simple audio input device selection
- Uses JUCE's built-in AudioDeviceManager
- Works with any existing audio input device
- ~200 lines of clean, cross-platform code
- Much more reliable and maintainable

## New Architecture

### AudioInputManager
- Handles enumeration of available input devices
- Manages audio device selection and configuration
- Provides input level monitoring
- Simple, clean interface

### MainComponent
- Now implements AudioIODeviceCallback directly
- Uses AudioInputManager to select input devices
- Processes audio through VST chain in real-time
- Includes visual input level meters

## How to Use

1. **Select Input Device**: Use the dropdown to select any available audio input device (microphone, line-in, etc.)

2. **Start Processing**: Click "Start Processing" to begin real-time audio processing

3. **Audio Flow**: 
   ```
   Input Device → VST Plugins → Audio Processor → Output Device
   ```

4. **Monitor Levels**: Watch the L/R level meters to see input signal strength

5. **Add VST Plugins**: Use the plugin chain component to load and configure VST3 plugins

## Benefits

- **Reliability**: No complex virtual device creation, uses standard JUCE audio I/O
- **Compatibility**: Works with any audio interface or input device
- **Simplicity**: Much cleaner codebase, easier to maintain and extend
- **Cross-platform**: Same code works on macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **Real-time**: Direct audio processing with minimal latency
- **User-friendly**: Clear input device selection, no external dependencies

## Files Changed

### Removed
- `VirtualAudioDriver.h` - Complex virtual device implementation
- `VirtualAudioDriver.cpp` - Platform-specific audio device creation

### Added
- `AudioInputManager.h` - Simple input device management
- `AudioInputManager.cpp` - Clean audio input handling

### Modified
- `MainComponent.h` - Changed from AudioAppComponent to AudioIODeviceCallback
- `MainComponent.cpp` - Complete refactor for new architecture

## Technical Notes

- MainComponent now implements AudioIODeviceCallback for direct audio processing
- AudioInputManager wraps JUCE's AudioDeviceManager for device selection
- Real-time audio processing happens in audioDeviceIOCallbackWithContext()
- Input level monitoring with peak detection and visual meters
- Proper audio device lifecycle management

This refactor makes the application much more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly while removing hundreds of lines of complex platform-specific code.
